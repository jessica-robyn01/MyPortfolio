        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Jess D'Angelo, and I am a graduate from Cabrini University. I majored in Graphic Design with a minor in Marketing. I have experience with print and digital projects, including publication design, web development, branding, and packaging. While I am enthusiastic about all things design, I specialize in branding and publication design. Nothing is more rewarding than being able to show someone something you made. My love for the arts and the creation of beautiful things has continually been a driving force for me. I have always had a passion for design, whether it was making posters for science classes or creating ceramics and sculptures. <br>
