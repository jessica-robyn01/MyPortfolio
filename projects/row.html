        <h1>Eat Sleep Row Website</h1>
        <p>Eat Sleep Row is a website for novice rowers and beginners. It teaches the basics from strength training to crew terminology. On the landing page, there is news about the rowing world to keep the newcomers in the loop. The color scheme featured below was inspired by earthy neutrals. The design of the logo was based loosely on the shape of an ore combined with the continuous effort and determination rowing requires.</p>
