        <h1>BRINK Architecture Magazine</h1>
        <p>BRINK is a magazine that includes articles on architectural trends and up-and-coming architects. Readers consist of mostly men ages 25-41. The masthead and font choices were inspired by the rigid and strong foundations of the building process. <br>BRINK was featured in AIGA Locally Sourced Digital Publication 2022, which showcases student work from the Philadelphia region.  </p>
