        <h1>Wake Up and Smell the Fires</h1>
        <p>Wake Up and Smell the Fires is a campaign targeting climate change and article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Climate change is an issue that is worsened by humans and affects life on Earth. Since it is such a vast issue, this design focuses on the wildfire crisis. It calls out the human race for not doing enough about it. It is our doing that is making natural disasters worse, and unless we open our eyes to what is going on around us the damage will be irreparable. <br>Graphic Design USA named the Wake up and smell the fires poster as a 2022 American Graphic Design award winner student competition. </p>
